        <h1>Local Libraries</h1>
        <p>
            There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other university libraries belonging to I-Share</li>
            <li>Public libraries</li>
        </ul>
    </main>

    <h2>I-Share Libraries</h2>
    <p>
        Many I-Share libraries will allow you to pull books directly from the shelf and check them out instantaneously
        so long as you can present your IIT ID card and there are no holds on your library account. Daley Library at the
        University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has an <strong class="blue">open stacks</strong> policy. UIC is also a
        <strong class="blue">Research I
            institution</strong>, so their library is quite extensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all area libraries belong to the I-Share system. For instance, Loyola University and the University of
        Chicago do not participate in I-Share. You may check out books, but only under certain conditions. You may not
        enter their facilities or browse their collections.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you plan on visiting an I-Share library to obtain your resource, consider the following:
    </p>

    <aside class="sidebar">
        <h2>Being Realistic</h2>
        <p>
            Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break or
            you are not allowed to browse the stacks as a non-student. When in doubt, call first.
        </p>
    </aside>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Where is the library located?</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Will you have to travel outside of Chicago? If so, consider interlibrary loan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can you enter the library?</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask if the library is open to the public. Although you are a registered student at an I-Share institution,
            different li
            braries have different rules about who can browse their book stacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are the library hours?</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Not every institution uses the semester system. DePaul University, for instance, uses the quarter system, so
            their school is closed at different times than IIT. Check the library website to verify hours
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Public Libraries</h2>
    <p>
        The Chicago Public Library (CPL) system is extensive, and contains a great deal of books that are in popular
        demand or hard to obtain from I-Share libraries (e.g. textbooks). If you do not live in Chicago, you cannot
        check books out of the library, but you can visit the library and read or copy the books. Most local libraries
        have similar policies. Visit a CPL location to obtain a library card (you will need to present proof of
        residency).
    </p>

    <h2>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library</h2>
    <p>
        After finishing another project, Bridgette returns to her research paper on Tech Comm prior to World War II. She
        notices that she had made a note to obtain <em>English for Engineers</em> by S. A. Harbarger, but that was over
        a week ago and she now only has ten days left to finish her paper. She decides to reassess her research timeline
        and concludes that she has enough time to read, analyze, and incorporate important elements of this resource
        into her paper, but in order to do so, she must have the resource and begin working immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognizing the need for an adjustment in the amount of time it takes her to obtain the resource, she decides to
        attempt to pick up the book herself from a local library. She sees a note she made that the book is available at
        the UIC library; since she has the title, author, local library, and call number, she is ready to proceed to the
        library. Prior to leaving, however, she checks the hours and policies of the UIC library on their website so she
        doesn't waste a trip.
    </p>

    <h2>When to Use Local Library Resources Instead of Interlibrary Loan</h2>
    <p>
        There are two situations where you should consider obtaining your resource through a local library rather than
        relying on interlibrary loan:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You no longer have enough time to wait for an interlibrary loan book to be delivered</li>
        <li>You cannot obtain the book through interlibrary loan because it is not available</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It is important to remember that CPL volumes are not listed in I-Share holdings information. Even though public
        libraries are located in Illinois, they do not participate in the I-Share system, so you must search at the CPL
        website to view available titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the final section of this lesson we'll explore the best way to obtain resources, the internet.
