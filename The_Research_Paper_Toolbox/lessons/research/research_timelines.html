        <h1>Research Timelines</h1>
        <h2>Formulating a timeline</h2>
        <p>
            It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have
            enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish
            your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a
            resource for your paper:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt;
                Remaining time before deadline</strong>
        </p>
    </main>

    <p>Let's unpack some of those terms</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Time to obtain resource</strong>: How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary
            loan? -<em>or</em>- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Time to read resource</strong>: How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a
            point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Time to integrate resource into your project</strong>: Even if you are able to read the resource, do
            you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project?
            If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this
            resource, or would it simply be better to indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that
            time constraints prevented you from including it?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remaining time before deadline</strong>: How much time is left before you must turn in your project?
            Is your resource powerful enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, requesting an
            extension might be in order.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>
            Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting
            your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research
            timeline.
        </p>

    <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
    <p>
        Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research
        paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field
        between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly
        databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to
        her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that she must
        decide whether it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or to move on and look for resources that are
        more easily available. To do this, she constructs a research timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides
        to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements
        of her project should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to request any
        resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have sufficient time to wait for resources
        to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has learned into her paper before she must turn in her final
        copy. She decides to read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover her topic as
        appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>Determining the best way to obtain resources</h2>
    <p>
        Even if you can obtain a resource, that doesn't mean you necessarily should spend your time doing so. Be sure to
        preview a resource by reading a book review or previewing the book on Google Books to make sure that it is
        valuable enough to obtain. If you have determined that it is feasible and worthwhile to obtain a resource within
        the timeline you have developed, you must next consider how to obtain that resource.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, the safest way to obtain resources is to physically obtain a copy yourself. However, that is often
        inconvenient, impractical, or unnecessary. In cases such as those, interlibrary loan or MyILL is your best
        option. However, interlibrary loan can take time. Consider these guidelines when requesting your resource
        through interlibrary loan or MyILL.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The stated turnaround time</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Problems can and do occur in transmitting library materials. For safety's sake, ask yourself the following
            question: "If it were to take twice as long as the stated turnaround time on the website, would I still have
            enough time to utilize the research?" Consider all of the factors in the formula above. If not, seek an
            alternative to interlibrary loan or MyILL.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The proximity of the lending library to your location</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            In the case of MyILL, articles are delivered exclusively online. However, if you are using WorldCat, your
            lending library may be located in Wisconsin, or it may be located in Canada, or Bulgaria, or Hong Kong.
            While chapters might be sent electronically, it takes time for books to be delivered from WorldCat
            libraries. Check the location of the lending library and take it into consideration when requesting
            materials from WorldCat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The possibility that your materials may not arrive before your deadline</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Can you complete your project without these materials? If you are still in the planning or topic selection
            phase, check for these materials and consider whether you will have enough time to utilize them in your
            project. If not, it would be wise to consider an alternative topic.
        </li>
    </ul>
