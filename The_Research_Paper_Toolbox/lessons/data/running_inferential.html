    <h1>Run inferential statistics</h1>
    <p>
        Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW. You can also download a
        30-day free trial.)
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select <strong>Open an existing data source > More
                Files...</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.
        </li>
        <li>
            From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the dataset.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the Analyze menu in the standard toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's <strong>Analyze</strong>
        menu, see if you can also find the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
        <li>Simple linear regression</li>
        <li>Non-parametric correlation</li>
    </ol>

            <img src="/images/datalesson_fig5.png" alt="PASW offers many statistical methods and tests under its 'Analyze' menu, from regressions and correlationss to descriptive statistics. If you don't see a particular test, it is likely located under a broader classification.">

    <p>
        You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the appropriate test. Go
        to <strong>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</strong> A new window will open
        prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the <em>perc_usefulness</em> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top
            arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).
        </li>
        <li>
            Select the <em>free_play</em> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it
            to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <strong>Define Range...</strong>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field.
            This specifies the two categorical variables to be tested. Your screen should now look like Figure 6.
            Click Continue.

        Click OK to display the statistical analysis results to new viewing window. Your results screen should look like
        Figure 7. Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical components (some of which must be cited in
        formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the PASW software. To save the results,
        go to <strong>File > Export</strong>. Change Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF,
        etc.), then click OK.
