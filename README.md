# Research Paper Toolbox: COM421 Sustainable Information Structure Project

Self-critique:
I decided to keep everything as close to the example documents as possible, with one exception: I separated each page into subpages for easier readability. Each pages' navigation is also located at the top for convenience. Additionally, I added subpage navigation at the footer in order to enhance navigation even more. The website also includes accessibility features like alt text and accommodating different window sizes. For the template page, I set up a general layout of the other pages, along with comments explaining what to do and how to make different elements seen throughout the website. 

Lastly, if I had more time, I would definitely look into improving the graphics of the page and make it more lively. It is pretty bare-bones, as I just went with a simple color scheme. Specifically, I would look into adding icons for each page and look more into different fonts and font sizes.
